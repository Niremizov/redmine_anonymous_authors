* Allows to the anonymous user to enter his name and e-mail address when adding an issue;
* Allows to the anonymous user to enter his name and e-mail address when adding a note to the issue;
* Displays the entered name and e-mail address anywhere in Redmine instead of "Anonymous";
* Notifies the author of anonymously created issue when it is updated. You can add a note to the issue and author will get the notification as a normal user;
